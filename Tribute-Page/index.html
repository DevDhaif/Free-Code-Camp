    Dazai's ability, titled No Longer Human, is based off the actual novel that Osamu Dazai published in the late 1940's. While the praised fictional novel deals with the psychological struggles of a man, Dazai's ability in Bungo Stray Dogs simply stops any ability power dead in its tracks. With this seemingly unexciting trait, Dazai makes it the perfect weapon for creating standstills with just a touch from his finger. To help complement his ability, Dazai is always one-step ahead of everyone else, as he is always looking for methods that ensure his victory in a conflict.
    <br><br>
    In the first season to Bungo Stray Dogs, Dazai acts mainly as comic relief due to his suicidal tendencies. From eating poisonous mushrooms that cause hallucinations to drowning in a river, Dazai's hilarious attempts at a painless suicide never gets old. He openly announces his desires for a double lover's suicide, hence his fawning over any new ladies introduced in the series. He's always pulling pranks and bickers with Kunikida, acting lazy and seems uninterested in serious matters.<br><br>
      If you've been following the Stray Dogs series, you'll probably ask what are Dazai's real intentions, or what are his goals? Dazai might have decided to change himself in response to Sakunosuke's death, but even so Dazai is still mysterious. Despite his betrayal to the Port Mafia, many of the members still respect him, and even the leader, Mori, continues to welcome Dazai with open arms. But does Dazai really side with either of the organizations? Is he a good or bad person overall? It's really hard to tell. All I can say is that Dazai has internal struggles within himself to truly display his personality, and probably only finds the thrill of being alive when he puts his life into danger multiple times.
